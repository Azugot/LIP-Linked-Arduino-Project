# LIP-Linked-Arduino-Project
A LIP(Programming Introduction Lab) project to make two separade arduino interact with each other via cable signals.

The first file(Arduino_1.ino) is both an *input* and an *output*, as well as its sister file(Arduino_2.ino).
The code is commented so it should not be a difficult task to modufy inputs and outputs.
